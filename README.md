# NanoCGR
NanoCGR: CGR Server

HOWTO:
Linux:
1.make or make d: make dynamic lib
  make s: make ststic lib
  NOTE: There are some problems making static lib, which will lead to
    instance loading failure. Using dynamic lib is suggested.
  That's all done. 
  Use make run_d or make run_s to run with the lib you built(s: ststic, d: dynamic).

Windows: using vs2013 to build the project.
